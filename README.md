# Building

*Windows*: The project uses dotnet 4.8, consider installing into your machine, you need visual studio, simple open the solution file open the Build section and hit the build button (ctrl + shift + b) or you can do into powershell the command dotnet build -c Debug if you have installed dotnet 4.8.

*Linux*: Unfortunately versions lower than 6 of dotnet do not have support for linux, the best thing you can do is install dotnet 6 or the lowest possible version on your distro and try to compile in dotnet 6 using the command dotnet build -c Debug, this can cause problems within rocket loader.
